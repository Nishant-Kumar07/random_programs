N
N integers. Monk is very superstitious. He calls the array 
A
A Lucky if the frequency of the minimum element is odd, otherwise he considers it Unlucky. Help Monk in finding out if the array is Lucky or not.

Input:
First line consists of a single integer 
T
T denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case consists of a single integer 
N
N denoting the size of array 
A
A.
Second line of each test case consists of 
N
N space separated integers denoting the array 
A
A.

Output:







# 4 8 3 7

num = input()


arr = map(int, raw_input().split())


min = arr[0]
dic = dict()
counter = 1
for i,v in enumerate(arr):
    #import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
    dic[v] = counter
    if v in dic:
        dic[v]+= 1
    if min > arr[i]:
        min = arr[i]

print min

print dic[min]
if dic[min]%2 ==0:
    print"UNLUCKY"
else:
    print"LUCKY"
