"""
Given an array A of size N. Given Q operations, each operation contains an integer D. In each operation you have to divide all the elements of the array by D.

For example, for each operation with a given D, the new array A would be:

A[0] / D, A[1] / D, A[2] / D, ..... , A[N-1] / D
Finally, after processing all the operations you have to print the final array after Q operations.
Note : The result of the each division will be an integer, for example 5 / 2 = 2

Input :
First line of input contains a single integer N denoting number of elements in the array A. Next line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A. Next line contains Q denoting number of operations. Next Q lines contains a single integer D by which divide the elements of the array.

Output :
Print single line containing N space separated integers after processing Q operations.

Constraints:
1<=N<=100000
1<=Ai<=1000000
1<=Q<=100000
1<=D<=1000

In operation 1 after dividing the whole array by D=2, the resultant array will be : [25, 10, 9, 13, 9] In operation 2 after dividing the array from operation 1 by 3, the resultant array will be : [8, 3, 3, 4, 3] In operation 3 after dividing the array from operation 2 by 2, the resultant array will be : [4, 1, 1, 2, 1] So, the resultant array will be [4, 1, 1, 2, 1]
